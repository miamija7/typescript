********** Tuples & Enums **********

Tuples:
- arrays fixed in length & type
- tuples are a special type exclusive to TypeScript
- tuples DO NOT exist in JavaScript
- tuples are arrays of fixed lengths and ordered with specific types--like super rigid arrays


Enums:
- enums allow us to define a set of named constants
- constants can be numeric or string values
- limit responses
    + UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
    + PENDING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED
- enums are a set of named constants


Enums Compile to JS...
- almost all typescript will be removed on JS compile
- enums result in additional JS code
- enums are phasing away because it's creating new JS code
- "pollutes" JS code
- to not populate JS... add "const" to enum declaration!
    // make a const enum
    const enum OrderStatus{...}
