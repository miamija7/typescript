********** File Type Annotation **********


Where do we apply TS?
- Functions: "This function returns an array of strings" or "This function accepts two numbers and returns a number"
- Objects: "This object must have a property called colors, set to some array of strings"
- Variables: "This variable is a string"


TS Variable Annotation:
- Ex: let myVar: type = value


Type Inference:
- refers to the TS compiler's ability to infer types from certain values in your code.
- TS can remember a value's type even if you didn't provide a type annotation, and it will enforce that type moving forward.


Any:
- 'any' is an escape hatch! It turns off type checking for this variable, so you can do your thing.
- NOTE: it sort of defeats the purpose of TS and types, so use it sparingly
