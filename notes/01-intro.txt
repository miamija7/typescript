********** TypeScript Introduction **********


Static Checking:
- TypeScript detects errors in out code without running it.


Type Checking:
- TypeScript does this error checking on the basis of the "kinds of data" in our program.


Why Types? TypeScript's Type System...
    + Helps us find errors!
    + Analyzes our code as we type
    + Only exists in development


Superset:
- Everything in JavaScript is valid in TypeScript, plus extra TypeScript syntax
- Lots of TypeScript boils down to little JavaScript
