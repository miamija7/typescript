********** Interfaces **********

Interfaces:
- most commonly used pieces of ts
- very similar type aliases
- used to create reusable, modular types
- they describe the shapes of objects
- interfaces can re-open to add new properties


Types vs. Interfaces:
Interfaces:                                         Types:
can ONLY describe the shape of an object            can describe literal types and shapes
can reopen/add on                                   cannot reopen/add on
Extending (more OOP)                                Intersection types (&)


Extending Interfaces:
- extend/inherit interfaces
