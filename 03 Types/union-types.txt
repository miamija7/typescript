********** Union Types **********

Union Types:
- union types allow us to give a value a few different possible types
- if the eventual value's type is included, TS will hbe happy
- we can create a union type by using the single | (pipe) to separate desired types
- "this thing can be this or this"


Unions - Narrowing the Type:
- narrowing is simply doing a type check before working with a value
- handle a string vs number differently
- unions allow multiple types of value, so check type before working on input


Literal Types:
- literal types are not just types... but values themselves too
- fine-tunes type options for TS to enforce
- almost always used with union type
